# Ranked Choice Voting tabulator
### To verify 2018 Maine CD2 Ranked Choice Voting election results
### Scotty Vercoe, November 2018

**This code was written to verify the official results of the first Ranked Choice Voting election in the history of the United States.**

The election turned out to be remarkably transparent. Since the incumbent has charged that RCV is a "black box" I thought it important to dispel any false notions, and show how cleanly and simply the system works.

### Get the data
Download all the CSV files I provide (there are 8)

**OR**
1. Download all "DISTRICT 2 FINAL" files from the Secretary of State's Office.
2. Convert them all to CSV, putting them all in the same folder.

### Run the script
Download rcv.py (or rcv_2.py if using Python2) and place in the same folder as the CSV files.
At a command prompt/terminal, run the file:
```
python rcv.py
```
Ballots are loaded, then the tabulator runs the instant runoffs:
```

### Running on other elections
The tabulator can be used to run any Ranked Choice Voting election with any size list of ballots, where each ballot itself is a ranked list.

While the ballots list contain indexed candidates (by int), the program uses a single key of candidates for human-readable output. The same key is used to read the ballots from CSV files.

Make your ranked choice ballots a list of lists of ints:
```
[ [0,4,1], [2,3,0], ... ]
```
### Tips for running on other elections
• Ballots can be different lengths w/ incomplete rankings

• If you have other ballots as CSV files, just change fields to specify which fields in the CSV contain rankings. Make your key of indexed candidates.

• Key needs to be as long as your longest ballot

• Currently, two fields overvote/undervote are in the key. Remove these fields from the key, and change the init value for dropped to an empty list.

• Edit or remove the ballot rules as needed.
